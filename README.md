# Fresh Food Farms — Analytics & Forecasting

This project is part of my portfolio work where I analyze data from Fresh Food Farms to understand customers, products, and store performance. The goal is to explore the data, build useful metrics, and create models that can help in decision making.

## Main Focus
- Understanding the customer base and demographics  
- Finding best-selling products and sales trends  
- Assigning employees based on footfall patterns  
- Using video analytics and path heatmaps to study in-store behavior  
- Forecasting hourly footfall with ARIMA models  

## Tools and Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- scikit-learn (machine learning models)  
- statsmodels, pmdarima (time series forecasting)
