# Fresh Food Farms — Analytics & Forecasting

- Finding best-selling products and sales trends  
- Assigning employees based on footfall patterns  
- Using video analytics and path heatmaps to study in-store behavior  
- Forecasting hourly footfall with ARIMA models  

## Tools and Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- scikit-learn (machine learning models)  
- statsmodels, pmdarima (time series forecasting)
